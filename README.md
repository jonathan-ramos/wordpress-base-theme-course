# Archive Template

The archive portion of WordPress can be anywhere from tags, categories and older posts. Anything that provides an archived list for WordPress will work off this template.

## index.php

If there is no `archive.php` file then WordPress will use the `index.php` for all archive needs.

## archive.php

All you would need to do is create an `archive.php` file and alter it to suite your theme needs.

## Additional archive templates

As mentioned before you can have additional control if for the different types of archive files. Those files are listed below:

- author.php - for all authors to the blog
- category.php - for all categories listed in the blog
- date - archive blog posts by date
- tag.php - for all tags related to the site
