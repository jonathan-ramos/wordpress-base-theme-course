# Front Page Template

When you are creating a web page with WordPress remember first that WordPress is blog first and on initial install you have to do a little extra work to make it website first. In the settings you need to go to dashboard then go to `Settings > Reading` and you will see that you can control what part of WordPress shows up first on first load.

Here you can check `A static page` and select front page dropdown to select a page in the system to serve as the home page.

When this is selected the default file that will be used would be the `index.php` file. However we could have a different look just for the main root of the page. If you create a `front-page.php` then WordPress will use this file as the homepage theme file.
