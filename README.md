# WordPress Theme Creation

Welcome to the WordPress Theme Creation course. In this course we will go through the ins and outs of creating your own WordPress theme. Not only will we discuss how to break a theme apart but we will also discuss where these broken up pieces should go. 

We will talk about WordPress' inner workings of how a theme actually loads and what gets partial theme gets loaded when you visit a certain type of page.

So open up your editors, grab some caffiene and lets get busy.
